# Prework - Ops 401: Cybersecurity Engineering

This is the mandatory pre-work for Ops 401. When this course nears its start date, you will be invited to an online portal named Canvas where you can confirm that you've completed this pre-work and claim credit.

Start on the pre-work as soon as you can and be sure to allow yourself plenty of time to complete it.

> **Note: All pre-work is due before start of first class**

## Lab Expectations 

Many lab activities in Ops 401 will require the virtualization of two or more computers on your Lab PC. Typically there will be a toolkit PC (e.g. Kali Linux) and a target of evaluation that you will perform tests against. In some scenarios, you will need to deploy new applications on both the host and virtualized PCs, so keep an eye on your hard disk capacity.

## Ops Lab Kit

If you are testing in, and don't yet have an Ops Lab Kit, ensure you get one delivered in time for the start of class. 

- Obtain and unbox your lab kit. 
- Ensure all items are present. 
- Test computer, monitor, keyboard, and mouse. 
- If you haven't installed an operating system yet, the computer should display a short startup sequence that will result in a boot failure error. This is expected. We will take care of that as a part of class.
