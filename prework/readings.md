# Readings: Engineering Topics

Below is a collection of resources of varying types and lengths which describe the topics for the upcoming lecture.  As you go through the readings each day, you'll find that certain sources work better for your reading and learning style. Focus on those, but also branch out and consume the material in different forms.

**For your assignment, go through these resources, and create a new page/entry in your *readings repository* or *Wiki* that summarizes the principle topic as though you were presenting the material to a 301 level student.**

Wiki Entry Ideas:

* Blog Article (2-3 paragraphs with code sample)
* Dictionary / Flash Cards
* Notes in outline form
