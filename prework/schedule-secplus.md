# Schedule CompTIA Security+ Certification Exam

The curriculum of Ops 401 is aligned to the [learning objectives](https://www.comptia.org/training/resources/exam-objectives){:target="_blank"} of the CompTIA Security+ certification. Earning this certification demonstrates foundational knowledge of information security. For this prework assignment, you'll purchase a voucher and schedule your CompTIA Security+ exam to be taken at the end of the course.

## Objectives

- Purchase a voucher for CompTIA Security+
- Purchase the Sybex CompTIA Security+ Study Guide
- Schedule your CompTIA Security+ SY0-601 exam for a date prior to demo day

## Tasks

- First you'll need to access the [CompTIA Store](https://store.comptia.org/){:target="_blank"} and access the "Certification Vouchers" section. Check with your instructor if your school qualifies for the CompTIA Academic Partner program, which offers a discount to voucher prices.
- Purchase a CompTIA Security+ Voucher. It will email you a voucher code that you'll need to use on the Pearson Vue testing site next. Once you have received the voucher code, you're ready to proceed to the next step. 
- You'll need a study guide to use as a reference during your studies leading up the certification exam. Purchase an ebook or hardcopy of [Sybex CompTIA Security+ Study Guide](https://www.amazon.com/CompTIA-Security-Study-Guide-SY0-601/dp/1119736250/){:target="_blank"}.
- Access the [Pearson Vue test scheduling website](https://home.pearsonvue.com/Clients/CompTIA.aspx){:target="_blank"}. Note that this site is for CompTIA testing specifically. If you have never scheduled a CompTIA exam through Pearson Vue, you'll need to [create an account](https://wsr.pearsonvue.com/testtaker/profile/create/SignUp.htm?clientCode=COMPTIA&locale=en_US){:target="_blank"} first.
- Sign in and schedule the CompTIA Security+ with either a testing center or virtually from home. Ensure that you schedule your exam for a date prior to the final day of class, which is project demo day.
- Once you have scheduled your exam, take a screenshot of your exam appointment date and time. Paste this into your Google Doc. Explain how you will use the study guide to prepare you for the exam.

At the end of this course, you will submit your final grade on the Security+ exam.
