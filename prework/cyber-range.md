# Cyber Range Guidelines & Resources

Many labs, ops challenges, and project activities in Ops 401 will necessitate the deployment of a controlled cyber range to allow for the testing of your various tools, scanners, and exploits. Cyber ranges exist in military and government agencies, industries and private installations. They come in all shapes and sizes, and you can setup a basic range at home using virtualization. Cyber ranges allow us to simulate aggressive security operations while abiding by industry-accepted standards of conduct such as the [ISC2 Code of Ethics](https://isc2chapter-phoenix.org/index.php/membership/isc-2-code-of-ethics).

## Virtualization Platform

- [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
- [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/)
- [GNS3](https://www.gns3.com/)

## Toolkit Systems

Here are various resources to use as your toolkit system.

- [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/)
- [Parrot OS](https://parrotsec.org/)
- [Flare VM](https://github.com/fireeye/flare-vm)

## Target Systems

Here are various resources to use as your target system.

- [10 Places to Find Vulnerable Machines for Your Lab](https://blog.rapid7.com/2011/12/23/where-can-i-find-vulnerable-machines-for-my-penetration-testing-lab/)
- [13 Vulnerable Websites & Web Apps for Pen Testing and Research](https://sectigostore.com/blog/13-vulnerable-websites-web-apps-for-pen-testing-and-research/)
- [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/login)
  - Hack the Box offers many target systems accessible via VPN. Their premium membership offers additional targeting and learning opportunities.

## Deployment Considerations

Take care when configuring your cyber range to consider these factors:
- How will the hosts communicate?
- Will my scope of work be contained to the cyber range?
- Will my actions negatively affect other systems in my home network or systems belonging to others?
- If using cloud, does my cloud provider approve of the activities I am about to partake in?
- Are the actions I am taking legal and ethical?
- What are the hosting costs incurred by my cyber range?
- What are the infrastructure dependencies involved with hosting my cyber range the way I've chosen to?
