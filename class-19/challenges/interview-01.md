## Interviewer Notes

Key areas to explore and discuss:

- "**AWS CloudTrail** is a service that provides a history of the AWS API calls for every account. It lets you perform security analysis, resource change tracking, and compliance auditing of your AWS environment as well. The best part about this service is that it enables you to configure it to send notifications via AWS SNS when new logs are delivered." -[Simplilearn](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/aws-tutorial/aws-interview-questions) 
- "**Amazon CloudWatch** helps you to monitor the application status of various AWS services and custom events. It helps you to monitor:
  - State changes in Amazon EC2
  - Auto-scaling lifecycle events
  - Scheduled events
  - AWS API calls
  - Console sign-in events" -[Simplilearn](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/aws-tutorial/aws-interview-questions) 
- "Here is a selection of [VPC] security products and features:
  - **Security groups** act as a firewall for the EC2 instances, controlling inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level.
  - **Network access control lists** act as a firewall for the subnets, controlling inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level.
  - **Flow logs** capture the inbound and outbound traffic from the network interfaces in your VPC." -[Simplilearn](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/aws-tutorial/aws-interview-questions)
