# Security Event Analysis with Splunk SIEM

## Overview

A threat detection ecosystem is an essential part of efficient incident response. SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tools help us aggregate valuable event logs and network traffic information from across the enterprise, granting full visibility to the security operations technician of the events taking place on the network. A proficiency in SIEM tools will allow you to respond quickly to security events unfolding in real time.
