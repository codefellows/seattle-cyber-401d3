# Interview 01

## Interview Question

Ask the candidate: 

"In our security team, we often discuss issues in terms of **risk**, **vulnerability**, and **threat**. How would you define these terms?"

- Provide an example of a computer security risk, and how you handled it.
- How do you prioritize security problems based on risk?
- Provide an example of a computer security vulnerability in a web application, and how it should be evaluated.
- Provide an example of a cyber threat, and how it can be analyzed.
- What is a TTP?
- What is Atomic Red Team, and how would you recommend my SOC implement it?
- What is MITRE ATT&CK®, and how is it used for threat modeling?

## Interviewer Notes

- A **risk** is "the possibility of damage or harm and the likelihood that damage or harm will be realized." -CISSP Glossary
- A **vulnerability** is a "weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source." -NIST
- A **threat** is "a malicious act that seeks to damage data, steal data, or disrupt digital life in general. Cyber threats include computer viruses, data breaches, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and other attack vectors." -Upguard
- An example of a computer security risk is having unpatched servers or critical infrastructure.
- Security problems are sometimes prioritized according to risk assessment and BIA, or business impact analysis. 
- An example of a web application security issue is being vulnerable SQL injection.
- An example of a cyber threat is a DoS (denial of service) attack.
- A **TTP* (tactics, techniques, and procedures) includes the activities or methods associated with a specific threat actor or group of threat actors.
- The **Atomic Red Team** is a collection of small, highly portable detection tests mapped to MITRE ATT&CK®. This gives defenders a highly actionable way to immediately start testing their defenses against a broad spectrum of attacks.
- **MITRE ATT&CK®** is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.
