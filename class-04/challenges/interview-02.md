# Interview 02

## Interview Question

 Ask the candidate: 
  - "What is a cybersecurity framework?"
    - What is an example of a cybersecurity framework?
  - "What is compliance?"
    - What compliance standards do cyber professionals commonly engage with? Name and define them to the best of your ability.
    - How can an organization achieve a specific compliance standard? 
      - Gap assessment
      - Implementation of required controls and processes
      - Explore how auditing relates to compliance.
      - What is a cybersecurity assessment and who performs it?

## Interviewer Notes

Key areas to explore and discuss:
- A **cybersecurity framework**  is a series of documents defining the best practices an organization follows to manage its cybersecurity risk.
  - Candidate should provide an example of a framework. The **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** is a set of guidelines that private sector companies can follow to identify, detect, and respond to cyberattacks, including ways to prevent and recover from attacks. The five main functions of the CSF include:
    - Identify
    - Protect
    - Detect
    - Respond
    - Recover
- Generally, **compliance** is defined as conforming to rules and meeting requirements. 
- **Cyber compliance** is a more specific category of compliance. It involves creating a program that implements risk-mitigation  controls to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of critical IT systems and information.
- Various compliance standards exist to serve the needs of different sectors and industries. Candidate should name as many examples as possible:
  - HIPAA
  - PCI-DSS
  - GDPR
  - CCPA
  - NIST (many)
  - ISO (many)
  - SOC (many)
- Compliance is achieved through implementing the required controls and processes dictated by the compliance framework. 
- To verify compliance, **auditing** is performed. A third-party auditing team uses a ‘checklist’ that validates the policies a cybersecurity team stated are actually in place, and that there are control mechanisms in place to enforce them.
- Alternatively, a **cybersecurity assessment** can be performed by an internal team and is generally less formal of a process than hiring an external auditor.
